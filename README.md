## The Story <a name="story"></a>

LiquidOverlay is a program we made that is aiming to assist the HoH and Deaf community around the world have the ability to enjoy video games. Upon listening to Steven Spohn's speech at the LiquidHacks opening ceremony we were able to see how gaming can be used to make a difference in a persons life. Specifically the lives of those that need assistive technology. We were inspired to make a difference.

The idea started in a Google Doc where we compiled a list of options for the competition with the goal of enhancing the gaming experience and accessibility. When we researched the accesibility options offered for the competitive FPS game "Valorant" we saw that there were none offered to address this community. Given that this game is heavily reliant on sound from agents ability to footsteps and gunshots we realized that to be able to play this game competitivly this is a necessary tool. We wanted to level the playing field for the HoH and Deaf community.  How would we accomplish this? We decided to make an overlay that uses visual effects to help deaf people "see sound". This would facilitate the process and allow them to visually see what the other players can hear.

This idea grew and we asked ourselves, why stop there? What can we add to make this a tool for even more people? This led our team to look into Speech to Text and Text to Speech tools to help non verbal players participate in voice chat and discord calls.
